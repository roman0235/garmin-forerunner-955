With frequent updates, you can rely on your Forerunner 955 for accurate navigation whether you're running through a city or exploring remote trails.

What Maps Come with the Garmin Forerunner 955?
The Forerunner 955 typically includes:

How to Perform a Garmin Forerunner 955 Map Update
1. Using Garmin Express (Recommended Method)
Garmin Express is the official application for updating maps and software on your Garmin devices.

Steps:

Download and install Garmin Express on your Windows or Mac computer.

Connect your Forerunner 955 to the computer using the included USB cable.

Launch Garmin Express and add your device if it hasn’t been registered already.

Garmin Express will automatically check for:

Software updates

Map updates (including regional TopoActive maps)

If a map update is available, you’ll see the option to install it.

Click Install and follow the on-screen instructions.

Keep the device connected until the update is complete.

Note: Map files are large, so the process may take a while depending on your internet speed and device storage.

2. Managing Storage Space
Map updates often require several gigabytes of free space. Here’s how to manage your storage:

Delete unused music files, apps, or maps for other regions you don’t need.

You can remove maps via Garmin Express or directly from the device if needed.

If you're running low on internal memory, you may be limited in how many additional regions you can install.

3. Using Wi-Fi for Small Updates
While full map updates must be done via USB and Garmin Express, your Forerunner 955 can download small content and firmware updates over Wi-Fi, including:

Satellite data (for faster GPS lock)

Minor routing adjustments

Bug fixes

To enable this:

Ensure your watch is connected to Wi-Fi through the Garmin Connect app.

Place the watch on the charger.

Updates will download and install automatically in the background if enabled.

Adding or Replacing Maps
If you’re traveling or want to explore new regions, you can install maps for other areas:

Connect your watch to Garmin Express.

Select your device, then click Tools & Content > Purchased (if you’ve bought new maps) or Manage Maps.

Download and install maps for additional regions as needed.

Garmin also offers free TopoActive maps for many regions, or you can purchase premium maps like City Navigator or Garmin TOPO PRO for more detailed coverage.

Tips for a Smooth Map Update
Fully charge your device before starting an update.

Use a stable and fast internet connection for large map files.

Don’t disconnect the USB cable during the update process.

Restart your watch after updating to ensure maps load correctly.

Common Issues and Fixes
Map update fails or is incomplete: Ensure enough storage is available. Try restarting the update in Garmin Express.

Device not recognized by computer: Use a different USB port or cable, or reinstall Garmin Express.

Slow navigation performance: Reboot the device after updating, and allow the new map data to index properly.

Final Thoughts
The Garmin Forerunner 955 map update process is simple but essential to maintaining the watch’s powerful navigation features. Using Garmin Express ensures your maps are accurate, complete, and up to date—whether you're using them for trail running, cycling, or route planning during a race.

By staying on top of updates, your Forerunner 955 will continue to be a reliable training partner and navigation tool, keeping you on course and confident wherever your workouts take you.
